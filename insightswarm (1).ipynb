    "# 📖 Project Overview\n",
    "InsightSwarm is an autonomous, production-grade multi-agent system designed to revolutionize how enterprises interact with their data. Built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and powered by Gemini 2.5, InsightSwarm replaces static dashboards with an intelligent, memory-aware workforce that can ingest raw data, extract strategic insights, and generate visual reports without human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard chatbots, InsightSwarm features Long-Term Institutional Memory, Self-Correcting Code Generation, and a full AgentOps Suite (Safety, Observability, FinOps) to ensure reliable deployment in enterprise environments."

    "\n",
    "Data Silos: Engineers, Analysts, and Managers work in disconnected loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corporate Amnesia: Agents usually \"forget\" context between sessions. If an analyst discovers a trend in Q3, the agent forgets it by Q4.\n",
