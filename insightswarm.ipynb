Built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and powered by Gemini 2.5, InsightSwarm replaces static dashboards with an intelligent, memory-aware workforce that can ingest raw data, extract strategic insights, and generate visual reports without human intervention.\n\nUnlike standard chatbots, InsightSwarm features Long-Term Institutional Memory, Self-Correcting Code Generation, and a full AgentOps Suite (Safety, Observability, FinOps) to ensure reliable deployment in enterprise environments.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 🎯 Problem Statement\nIn the modern enterprise, data analysis is a bottleneck.\n\nData Silos: Engineers, Analysts, and Managers work in disconnected loops.\n\nCorporate Amnesia: Agents usually \"forget\" context between sessions. If an analyst discovers a trend in Q3, the agent forgets it by Q4.\n\nFragility: Standard AI code generators often fail when libraries change or data is messy, requiring human debugging.\n\nSafety Risks: Deploying LLMs on private data risks PII leakage and hallucinations.\n\n# 💡 The Solution\nInsightSwarm solves these problems via a \"Memory-Augmented Hive Architecture\":\n\nObserve: It scans SQL databases and historical context (Memory Bank).\n\nThink: It plans analysis strategies aligned with corporate goals (RAG).\n\nAct: It autonomously writes/fixes SQL and Python code to visualize data.\n\nRemember: It extracts key findings from every session and consolidates them into a persistent SQLite Knowledge Graph.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 🏗️ System Architecture\nInsightSwarm utilizes a Hierarchical Hybrid Architecture, combining Sequential workflows for reliability and Loop patterns for quality control.\n\n## 🧩 Agent Topology\nThe Orchestrator (Root): Manages the hand-off between specialized agents and injects Long-Term Memory into the context window.\n\nSenior Data Engineer: Specialized in SQL generation, schema understanding, and data cleaning.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Specialized in RAG (retrieving business KPIs) and synthesizing data trends against historical memory.\n\nVisualization Loop (Self-Correcting): A nested sub-system containing:\n\nVizExpert: Generates Python plotting code (Matplotlib/Seaborn).\n\nDesignCritic: Reviews charts for brand compliance and errors. If a chart fails, the loop retries automatically.\n\n## 🔄 Core Components\nGoogle ADK: The backbone for agent definition, session management, and runtime.\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash-Lite: The reasoning engine, optimized for speed and cost efficiency.\n\nActive Memory Bank: A custom SQLite-based system that performs \"Extraction\" and \"Consolidation\" of insights.\n\nGuardrails Layer: A pre-flight interceptor that scrubs PII and blocks malicious prompts using Regex/Logic.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ⚙️ Technical Implementation\n## 1. Intelligent Tooling\nWe moved beyond simple function calling to Robust Engineering:\n\nSelf-Healing Tools: The run_local_analytics tool captures Python tracebacks and feeds them back to the LLM, allowing the agent to fix its own syntax errors.\n\nCaching Layer: A @cache_result decorator reduces latency and cost by storing results of expensive SQL or RAG queries.\n\n## 2. Context Engineering (Memory)\nInsightSwarm implements the \"Active Memory\" pattern described in the Google Whitepapers:\n\nExtraction: After every run, the system analyzes the conversation to find new facts (e.g., \"West region performance is down\").\n\nConsolidation: New facts are merged into the memory_bank table, ensuring the agent gets smarter over time.\n\nRetrieval: Before every run, relevant historical context is injected into the System Prompt.\n\n## 3. AgentOps & Observability\nThe system includes a full operational suite:\n\nEnterprise Logger: Structured SQL logging for all traces (Inputs, Outputs, Tool Calls).\n\nFinOps Dashboard: Calculates token usage and estimates cost per session ($0.00001 precision).\n\nCI/CD Smoke Tests: A pre-deployment script that verifies DB connectivity and tool integrity before runtime.\n\nRAI Scanner: An automated safety check for toxic language and bias in the final output.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 🌊 Data Flow Pipeline\n1.

However, if the data is empty, it will not attempt to save a plot. The `plt.savefig` is inside the `else` block, which is correct, but the initial prompt asked for a pie chart to be generated and saved. If there's no data, no plot is generated. This is acceptable behavior, but it's worth noting.\n\n2.  **Corporate Color Usage:** The corporate color `#1f77b4` is defined but is only explicitly used if there is exactly one product category. The rest of the time, `plt.cm.Paired` is used, which may or may not include the corporate color. For consistency and adherence to the prompt, the corporate color should be prioritized or used more broadly.\n\n3.  **Saving the Plot:** The prompt asked to save the chart as `final_analysis.png`. The code saves it as `final_analysis.png`. However, the previous `render_plot` tool call indicated an error because it was looking for `dashboard.png`. The most recent `VizExpert_V2` response *modified* the code to save as `dashboard.png`, and the print statement was updated accordingly. This means the tool might be expecting `dashboard.png` now, but the original request was `final_analysis.png`. This is a discrepancy. Assuming the goal is to get *a* file saved, `dashboard.png` is fine, but it deviates from the original instruction.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consistent Filename:** Decide on a single filename. If the requirement is `final_analysis.png`, ensure `plt.savefig` and the print statement use that exact name. If the tool's error indicates it's looking for `dashboard.png`, then use that. For this review, I'll assume `final_analysis.png` was the intended name.\n\n2.  **Broader Corporate Color Use:** Modify the `colors` argument in `plt.pie` to more consistently incorporate the corporate color. A simple approach would be to use a colormap that starts with the corporate color or to map the corporate color to the largest slice if there are multiple categories.\n\nHere's the revised code addressing these points, prioritizing `final_analysis.png` and attempting to use the corporate color more broadly:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.colors as mcolors\n\n# Assume 'data' is a pandas DataFrame loaded from your data source\n# with columns like 'Region', 'Revenue', 'Customer_Sentiment', 'Product_Category'\n\n# For demonstration purposes, let's create a sample DataFrame\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Region': ['East', 'East', 'East', 'East', 'West', 'West', 'North', 'South', 'East', 'East'],\n    'Revenue': [1000, 1500, 1200, 800, 2000, 1800, 1300, 1100, 900, 1100],\n    'Customer_Sentiment': [4.5, 3.8, 4.2, 3.5, 4.0, 3.9, 4.1, 3.7, 4.3, 3.9],\n    'Product_Category': ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Electronics', 'Home Goods', 'Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Goods', 'Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Goods']\n})\n\n# Filter data for the 'East' region\neast_data = data[data['Region'] == 'East'].copy()\n\n# Check if east_data is empty\nif east_data.empty:\n    print(\"No data available for the 'East' region.\")\nelse:\n    # 1.
